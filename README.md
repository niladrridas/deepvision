# DeepVision: Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

## Overview
DeepVision is an image classification project that employs TensorFlow and Keras to build a powerful deep learning model. This project focuses on classifying images using the MobileNetV2 architecture and is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, encompassing a wide range of objects.

## Key Features

- Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow and Keras.
- Model Architecture: MobileNetV2 for efficient image classification.
- Dataset: CIFAR-10, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
- Training: The model is trained over 5 epochs, with configurable hyperparameters.
- Evaluation: Test accuracy and loss metrics provide insights into model performance.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib (for optional visualization)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/niladridas/deepvision.git
```
2. Directory:
```
cd deepvision
```
4. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Run the image classification script:
`python my_image_classifier.py`

2. Explore the training progress, final test accuracy, and optional visualizations.
